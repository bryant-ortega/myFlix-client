# MyFlix

## Objective
Build the front end for my own API, using React.

## Description
This is a  small CRUD web  application  that uses React for client-side app routing, and loads data  from  an  external  API.  Data is stored on MongoDB. MyFlix uses React Bootstrap to create and style components such as navigation bar, movie cards and registration forms.
